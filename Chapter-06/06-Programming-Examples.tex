\TallC{T}{his} chapter illustrates how we may apply the floating point extensions of FORTH, developed in preceding chapters, to some standard problems in numerical analysis.

\section{Infinite series}

Frequently we must evaluate a function defined by an infinite sum

\begin{align}
    f(x) = sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}x^{n}
\end{align}

where $x$ is a real number and $c_n$ is an infinite sequence of coefficients. The extensive mathematical theory\footnote{\textit{The Handbook of Mathematical Functions} ed. Milton Abramowitz and Irene Stegun (Dover Hlications, Inc, New York, 1965) - henceforth abbreviated HMF- is a mine of useful information and references, on this as well as many other aspects of numerical analysis.} of such functions tions can be summarized as follows: the series of terms only have meaning if -for fixed $x$- the sequence of partial sums

\begin{align}
    f_{N}(x) = sum_{n=0}^{N-1}c_{n}x^{x}
\end{align}

has a definite limit.

\subsection{Examples of Infinite series}
\TallC{P}{erhaps} the formal definitions will seem clearer after some concrete examples. We now examine some divergent an convergent series.

\subsubsection{Divergent examples}
What does it mean to say a series diverges? Consider the serices whose terms are all 1's (that is, $c_n = 1, x = 1$):

\begin{align}
    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...
\end{align}


The partial sum $f_N$ is just $N$, and therefore increases without limit as more terms are added. The series \textit{diverges}.

A harder case is the series whose terms are alternately 1's and -1's:

\begin{align}
    1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...
\end{align}

Depending on how the terms are grouped together, the partial
sums can have any value. Certainly the partial sums do not settle
down to any definite value. The series \textit{diverges}.

Yet a third case is the harmonic series

\begin{align}
    f_{N} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ... + \frac{1}{N}
\end{align}

It can be shown that for large $N$, $f_{N} is approximately $log_{e}(N)$, so the harmonic series \textit{diverges}.

\subsubsection{A convergent example}
Are there ever mes of infinite series that \textit{do} mean something? Obviously, or there could hardly be a theory of them! An example\footnote{This is the examle of Zeno's paradox where you are at one end of a sofa and an attractive person of the opposite gender is at the other end. You move half the distance, then half the remainder. Clearly an an infinite number of moves is necessary to achieve the desired proximity. Thus, according to Zeno, you never get there. According to Eq. 6, however, you \textit{do} get there and in a finite time, to boot!} is $c_{n}=1, x = \frac{1/2}$. Here the partial sums

\begin{align}
f_{0} =& 1                               \\
f_{1} =& 1 + \frac{1}{2}                 \\
f_{2} =& 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}   \\
........&........                        \\
\lim_{N\to\infty} \eq \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1-(\frac{1}{2})^{N}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2
\end{align}

\textit{do} have a definite limit, so the series converges.

\subsection{Numerical examples of convergent series}
How do we tell whether a series has converged? As a practice matter, we keep adding terms to the partial sum until it no longer changes, within the desired precision. Sometimes this can involve a great many terms, even when the series converges. There exists an extensive mathematical literature on testing for the convergence of an infinite series. Mathematicians have also developed many tricks for accelerating the convergence of slow converging series\footnote{HMF, Ch. 3 6 ff.}. Consulting the literature in difficult cases I strongly recommended - it can save time galore!

As an heuristic exercise, let us write some simple programs to evaluate partial sums and see how convergence works.

first we sum the terms $2^{-n}$ from Eq. 6. The flow diagram is shown in Fig. 6-1 below.

\begin{lstlisting}

SETUP: N=0 SUM=1
BEGIN
?CONTINUE ( 10 more terms?)
WHILE
NO YES
10 0 DO
Exit 2^{-n-1} = 2^{-n} / 2
SUM = SUM + 2^{-n-1}
n = n + 1
LOOP
REPEAT
\end{lstlisting}

Fig. 6-1 \textit{Computing 2 the hard way}

The corresponding program is

\begin{lstlisting}
    15 #PLACES !            \ set F. to 15 digits
    : NEXT.TERM
        ( n -- n+1 :: sum 2^-n -- sum'2^-n-1 )
        F2/ FUNDER F+ FSWAP 1+ ;
    : SET.UP FINIT F=1 F=1 0 ;
    : EXHIBIT CR DUP ." n = " .
        2 SPACES
        FOVER ." sum = " F. ;
    : ?CONTINUE  CR ." Another 10 terms?" ?YN ;
    \ ?YN expects a "y" or "n" from the keyboard and
    \ leaves -1 ( "true" ) if "y" is pressed, 0 if "n"
    : SUM SETUP
        BEGIN EXHIBIT ?CONTINUE
        WHILE 10 0 DO NEXT.TERM LOOP
        REPEAT ;
\end{lstlisting}

This is what a run looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
flOAD TEST.SUM Loading TEST.SUM ok
SUM
n = 0 sum = 1.00000000000000
Another 10 terms? Y
n = 10 sum = 1.919902343750000
Another 10 terms? Y
n = 20 sum =1.99999904632568
Another 10 terms? Y
n = 30 sum = 1.99999999906867
Another 10 terms? Y
n = 40 sum = 1.99999999999909
Another 10terms? N ok
\end{lstlisting}

The partial sums converge rapidly to 2 (which, as we saw in §1.1.2 above, is the exact sum).

For a second example, let us sum a standard infinite series representation for $\pi/4$: We note that the function $tan^{-1}(x)$(that is, $arctan(x)$ ) has the infinite series representation\footnote{HMF, Ch. 4 4.42}

tan‘l(x)=x—%+x?5-x7... (7)
Since a 45° right triangle has equal height and base, 5the tangent

of 45° is 1 (side opposite over side adjacent). That is ,

a = -i _ _ l 1 _ 1 l
4_tan (1)—1 3+5 7+9... (8)

Actually the series Eq. 8 is slowly converging and therefore a poor
way to compute 7r . But anyway, let us proceed. The flow diagram

is now that of fig. 6-2 below.

The first thing we notice is that the numbers seem to be converg-
ing to something; however, unlike the previous series, the differ-
ences between successive partial sums are fairly large.

An infinite series of terms that alterna e in sign and decrease in
magnitude is. guaranteed to converge . The error (that is, the
difference between a partial sum and the limit) is of the order of

the first neglected term and has the same sign. We see that for
this case, the error in computing rt is of order 2Jn, where n is the
number of terms in the sum. To get It to 3 significant figures,‘
therefore, we need about 1000 terms! This is why the series
representation for 4tan 1( 1)‘ rs not a very good way to calculate a.
A better way uses e. g. .,

7r 16tan (5) 4tan (239),

which converges much faster9.

“3-1 Function calls In FORTRAN

achieves readability by passing arguments to functions in a list. In
fact, function names can also be passed in the argument list. 111115,

summing an infinite series could be written

§§3-2 A function erI tor FORTH

We would like to extend to FORTH FORTRAN’s ability to write
a generic series summation function, passing the variable and the
name of the coefficient function as arguments. In other words, we
now face the task of devising the function protocol we plan to use
throughout the rest of the book and in our future programming
— a heavy responsibility since we do not know what form these
future programs will take. For once we must engage in top-dawn
programming!

We want our protocol to have several features:
s it must be telegraphic, i.e. it must immediately suggest what it

is doing — a matter of choosing good names.

e it must be simple to implement and easy to remember — the
advantages of using it must not be outweighed by complexity.

e it must be fast — a major drawback to FORTRAN's way ol
doing things is the overhead in function calls.

e It must be portable — it cannot depend on specific details 0
the FORTH implementation or the machine 1t 1s running on.

It is simpler to thread this particular maze in reverse: begin with
where we want to end up, and determine what steps got us there.
We suppose we have defined a generic power series summation
function, using the lfstack defined in Ch. 5 52595:

: SUMPOWERS (87zerr-- 21x --surn)
E G! \storeerror
FS>F DUP F>FS \gettypeofx
DUP G=1 \x“0
G=0 0 DUP --n=0 ::--x 10)

(--n::--xx“nc[n])
3 GPICK G' F>FS
(--n::--xx“ntermsum)
ENUF? NOT WHILE
G+
REPEAT G+ CLEANUP ;

AAA

The words E, ENUF? and CLEANUP have straightforward
definitions with obvious meanings; mine has not been defined
because we have yet to figure out what it will do.

Manifestly, edr.c must place the execution address (“code-field
address" — cfa) on the stack for EXECUTE to find. There are
several ways to accomplish this. Clearly, we want to keep the
variable that holds the cfa local, so it will not get confused with
another function’s cfa. While it is straightforward to define a
variable and then make it headerless —hence local— (via
BEHEAD", e.g.) we would prefer to avoid defining a variable at
all. Here is a perfect opportunity to use the return stack (rstack).

We imagine that SUMPOWERS expects the cfa of the function
c. on the stack. Then the first thing SUM.POWERS must do is
stash the cfa somewhere convenient but local. One such place is
the stack itself. Even easier, since SUMPOWERS does not use
the rstack explicitly (e.g. in a DO LOOP), is to let the first step
in SUMPOWERS be > R. Then the code for adr.c would be
merely R@. The final word, after invoking CLEAN.UP (that
drops unwanted items from the various stacks), then must be
RDROP (for systems without it, : RDROP R > DROP ; ).

The revised version of SUM.POWERS is then

52 “anecenderlalequations

A transcendental equation has the form

flx) = 0, (10)

where f(x) is a transcendental function rather than, say, a polyno-
mial or ratio of polynomials10 (rational function).

There are several standard methods for finding a (or possibly, the)
value of x that satisfies this equation, i.e. a root of Eq. 10 (which
might have many or no roots). '1?) guarantee that we find a root
we must know an interval of the x-axis that it certainly will be
found in. 'Iirr'o methods that can be applied under these circum-
stances are binomial search and regula falsl .

ssr Binary search

Let us look first at binomial search, since its algorithm is euy to

understand. We know some interval, It. s x 5 xx, contains a
root because f(x) changes sign when .1: goes from xL -xn . In
pseudocode (and FORTH flow chart) the binomial search algo-
rithm is shown in fig. 6-3 on page 128.

The method begins with upper and lower bounds on x that capture
the root. Next we look at f(xAV) halfway between xL and xglf
f =f(xAV) has the same sign as fl= f(xL), the new left end of the
interval becomes X". If the signs are opposite, xAV becomes the
new right end of the interval. The algorithm is done when left and
right ends agree within some predetermined accuracy.

Binary search has the following virtues: the time it takes to
achieve a given accuraqr is predictable, and it is guaranteed to
find a captured root. Creating a FORTH program from the
pseudocode skeleton of fig. 6-3 is left as an exercise.

Now we look at regula falsi, Latin for “rule of false approach"
Here the basic premise is:

0 Assume the root lies in the interval (x1, x3, and plot a straigli
line between the points (XL, fl) and (XE, f . l

o This line must intersect the_x-axis somewhere in the inte
and we take that point, call It x’, as our next guess.

a If x’ is to the left of the root, ad'ust the interval accordingly, an
the same if x’ is to the right 0 the root.

As fig. 6-4 on page 129 shows, the straight line is supposed
approximate the curve [(15). The new guess may be much closer

the root than is the midpoint of the interval (which was the neat
guess in binomial search).

the value of x - call itxo — at some initial time to , then advancing
the time by small increments d: =h, using the differential equa-
tion itself to give us x(t +h) given x(t).

For example, we could emand in Taylor’s series11

fig. 6-11 Second order Wunge—Kutta — results

Let us now compare the two algorithms for functions f(x,t) th:
lead to singular solutions. This time we consider the equation

1:1. (20'

whose exact solution is

x(t) = -log,(1—%t3). (25)

Manifestly, 25 blows up at 1= 3"“ =1.442... We expect 111
behavior to become apparent in the numerical solution. So we s

\begin{lstlisting}
:FNB FEXP G@ F"2 F';
([t] -- 07: x --i[x,t])

:EXACT F-1 TG@ (07:--t"3)
FDUP FDUP F’ F' F-3 fl F+ flN -
\end{lstlisting}

and say again
\begin{lstlisting}
USE( EXACT IS exact ok
USE( FNB % 0. %0 % 5. % 0.1 )RUNGE ok
\end{lstlisting}

The results of doing this with straight-, and then implicit Runge-Kutta are displayed in Fig. 6-12 (p. 140) and 6-13 (p. 141), respectively. We only show the second half of the interval (near the singular point) in either case.

The straight Runge-Kutta algorithm, without the fancy implicit solution for $x(t +h)$, appears more accurate near the singularity, although both methods are acceptably accurate. Does this mean implicit Runge-Kutta is no good? No!

The implicit scheme lost accuracy through roundoff: the arithmetic was insufficiently precise. To take advantage of the method’s power, we must increase the precision beyond one part in 10^{6}. This requires changing all scalars to 64—bit precision (\regc{REAL*8}) rather than 32-bit as we have done here. The generic fetch/store techniques developed in Chapter 5 and used here, permit this change with a minimum of fuss. We leave this as an exercise.
