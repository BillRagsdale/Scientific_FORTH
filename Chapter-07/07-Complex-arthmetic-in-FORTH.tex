ne of the most crucial features of FORTRAN for scientiﬁc
computation is the ease with which it embeds complex arith-

metic into formulae. No other compiled language has this fea-
turel. From time to time someone gets a bright idea, and adds
complex arithmetic to Pascal via subroutines (since Pascal func-
tions can return only a sir¥le number, and complex functions
must return two numbers) . The same problem would afﬂict C
and the new structured BASICS.

Recently, a mechanism for adding complex arithmetic to Pacal
by deﬁning a stack and using postfix notation has been proposed3.
Does this sound at all familiar?

This chapter deals with complex arithmetic and its implementa-
tion in FORI'H. We do not consider complex numbers whose real

 

1- APL yacefully admits complex numbers and functions, but is an interpreted language.

and imaginary parts are integers, since these are virtually useless.
in scientiﬁc computing. Therefore we perform complex arith-
metic solely in single— or double-precision ﬂoating point format.
We begin with a brief review of the complex number system.

The complex number system
he algebraic equation
x2-1=0 (n

has 2 roots, :1, in the standard number system (real numbers).
But the (otherwise quite similar) equation

f+1=0 (»

has no roots. That is, there is no ordinary number which, whet
squared, gives a negative result. Eighteenth century mathemat-
icians misliked a state of affairs wherein some polynomial equa-
tions of n’th degree had n roots, whereas others had n-2, n-4, etc-
This seemed disorderly and unpredictable. How much simple.
life would be if every polynomial of n’th Order could always b1
factored into n primitives of the form (xll are roots)

ao+alx+a2x2+m+a.,x'l

(3)

E an(x — x1)(x — x2) (x — x“)

§§1 Cartesian representation of complex numbers

In order that every polynomial have n roots it was necessary tn
extend the idea of number to include objects of the form

z=xl+yi (4)

where i is —by definition— a “number" whose square is —1; 1 it
a “number” whose square is + 1, and x and y are ordinary num!
bers. Conventionally, x is called the real part of z, and y thl
imaginary part:

I = R£(Z) . y = Im(2)- (5) !

amr-cmwmmomn 145

Thus the solutions of the polynomial equation
21 + 1 - o (6)
are
2 - 01 3: n (7)
(that is,x=0,y= :1).
Tb reassure readers who ﬁnd uncomfortable the notion of a

“number” i = FT whose square is negative, it is possible to ﬁnd
a 2X2 matrix representation for 1 (unit matrix) and l :

10 01
1=(..).:=(-..)

It is easy to verify that —in the sense of matrix multiplication —
ixi=—1,1xi=ixl=l,andlx1=1. (9)

These are just the usual multiplication rules for complex num-
bers. Note that x l and y i then mean multiplication of a matrix
by a scalar:

“(33), mil 3)

z=x+iy5 (3y i)

The complex numbers obey all the algebraic rules of ordinary

arithmetic — commutative and associative laws of multiplica-
tion and addition. They are complete in the sense that when we
multiply or add two complex numbers we get a complex number,
not some other kind of number:

(a+ib)(x+iy)=(ax—by) +i(ay+hx) (10)

(a+ib)(x+iy)=(ax-by) +i(ay+bx) (10)

For every complex number, 2 =x + r‘y, there is a corresponding.

complex conjugate complex number,
2' = x - iy. (11)

Each non-zero complex numberz has a multiplicative inverse 1/z.,

To see this, multiply numerator and denominator of NZ by thd .

1 z‘_ x _y

22 2222 x; ‘7’? X2 +.Y2

To divide one complex number 21 by another, 22, invert 22 an:

(Numbers that satisfy the addition, multiplication and closure
properties of real or complex numbers are said to form a ﬁeld.)

It is easy to prove that evenwhen the coefficients of an n’th degrc l
polynomial are complex, it has n roots that can be represented a;
complex numbers.

Complex numbers can be used to represent points in the x-y plant:
with y plotted vertically and x horizontally‘. ( Sometimes thi
graphical representation is called an Argand plot or Argantl
diagram. The x-y plane is then called the Argand plane.)

§§2 Polar representation of complex numbers

The complex number 2 = x + iy is said (remember the Argand

plane) to be represented in Cartesian form (after Rene Des-
cartes, the inventor of analytic geometry, Le. the idea of graphing
equations). However, it is equally valid to use the relationship
(Euler’s theorem)

e'05c0s0+ isin0 (14)
to write the polar representation of z,

z=nr , r20. (15)

Clearly, since 2' 5 M4), we have

NI—

r = J? = (x2 + yz) (16)
ands
9 = tan—1(y/x). (17)

Note that 0, sometimes called Arg(z), is deﬁned only up ta
multiples of 2:! — that is, adding 23 to an angle changes neither
sine nor cosine because of their periodicity. The relations between
(try) and (r, 0) are illustrated in Fig. 7- 1 above: '

52 Load, store, manipulate fstack

We now deﬁne FORTH words to perform complex arithmetc.’

All complex operations will be preﬁxed by the letter X6. We
assume all complex operations are performed on the FPU ice
speed, hence we shall give 87stack diagrams.

In 87stack (or fstack) diagrams 2 stands for complex number, i
for real part, and y for imaginary part. Where useful, the 87stacl
diagrams show the operations decomposed into real and imagii
nary parts. By convention the imaginary part is higher on the
fstack than the real part.

By now most FORTH code should be self-explanatory. Mair.
words have been coded in high-level FORTH because the over
head of threading is negligible compared with the time spent
executing.

With by-now obvious meanings we have

\ - - single 81 double-precision complex fetch and store.

The letter C is more mnemonic, but FORTH conventionally reserves C for preﬁaing byte (“ch82
acter”) operations — as in C@, Cl, etc. The complex extension supplied with ITS/FORTH Ilsa!
thepreﬁwahenit isunambiguous (asinC+,C—.C',C/,etc.),andCPwhenCalonewon‘t

worth deﬁning in code. Here is a code deﬁnition for the 801187

is virtually identical, allowing for minor differences in Intel and

'4 Roots of complex manners
n'th root of a complex number 2 is that complex number,
2“, whose n'th power is the original number. That is, as for

realnumbers,
(1%).I Hz (18)

it might seem almost trivial to deﬁne the n’th root of a complex
number in polar representation:

z-re” (19)
hence
2 VII 3 r Vile i9/n (20)

Certainly we know what we mean by the n‘th root of a positive
real number, and from Euler’s theorem we know how to evaluate

e"""'=-=cos9+t'sin2 (21)
I: II

However, we can also think of the n'th root 3 a solution of the
polynomial equation in the variable to

w" — z = 0. (22)
The lbndamental theorem ofalgebra proves that a polynomial of
n'th degree has exactly 11 roots; this implies there are n distinct

values of w that satisfy Eq. 22; ie., there are n distinct roots of 2.
How can we generate them? Let us call the root shown above

(in Eq- 20)
we I: r 1/n e iO/n
Then we can multiply wo by a factor

x.=e”"*’",k=o, l,...,n-1 (23)

to obtain it different numbers,

Wk=Woxk, k=0,...,n-1 '
the n’th power of each of which is z. Clearly, if k increases pas

n-1, the numbers wk simply repeat . Since it is neither possible:
nor desirable for a complex function to return all n roots of 2, we!
choose the principal one, wo. All complex root- ﬁnding functions:
should obey this convention. In general the simplest algorithm tat
calculate the n’th root of a positive real number is

r U" = eln(r)/n ' (24)

Then to complete the job of evaluating wo we would need to
calculate a sine and a cosine. Thus, 3 divisions, 2 multiplication;-
and 4 transcendental function calls are generally needed to eval-
uate the n'th root of a complex number.

However, for square roots (n = 2) there is a much more efficient
method based on ordinary square roots, which we shall now
describe.

§§1 Complex square roots

Our phase convention means the phase 0 of the square root of 2:
must lie between 0 and 7:, since that of z lies between 0 and 27!.

The algorithm can be understood using the half-angle formulae:
for sines and cosines (we used these to develop the trigonometric
functions in Ch. 4 §6):

1

cos (g) = (“Li-5A6) 2 (258)
1

sin (g) = (—1‘;°s 9): (25b)

versa.

and that
log.(ez) = z , (31)

we ﬁnd it consistent to define the complex logarithm as
