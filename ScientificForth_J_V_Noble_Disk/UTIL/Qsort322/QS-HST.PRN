          * Massive rewrite of QSORT internal routines to enhance per-
            formance, particularly  when sorting  large files.   QSORT
            now uses  all of  available memory  as its sort buffer, so
            the more  memory available, the better it works.  Tests on
            my machine  indicate a 2:1 performance improvement doing a
            simple sort  of a  4.5 meg  file with  a 400K+ sort buffer
            available.   One beta  tester showed a 6:1 performance im-
            provement sorting a 100 meg file!
          * Added provisions  to prevent  merge file  name  collisions
            when multiple  copies of  QSORT are  run concurrently on a
            network.
          * Added /N<term>[<term2>]  parameter for  newline  redefini-
            tion.
          * Removed newline  redefinition from  /D parameter,  and re-
            laxed requirements  for specifying  number of  fields.  If
            the delimiter  is not newline, <fields> need not be given,
            and QSORT  will permit a variable number of fields in each
            record.
          * Added @<command_file> parameter to permit QSORT parameters
            to be stored in an external file, and used repeatedly.

          * Documentation changed to reflect new shareware policy, and
            to point  out the need to enclose the messages redirection
            parameter ("2><file>") in quotes for later DOS versions.
          * No program changes.

                             Notes on Version 3.21                             Notes on Version 3.21                             _____________________

          * FINALLY  fixed the  bug causing QSORT to not notice it had
            run out or disk space!  (Thanks to Andy Woolls for report-
            ing the problem still existed.)
          * Added standard error redirection feature (see QSORT.PRN).
          * Modified  command line parameter parsing.  You may now re-
            liably run  parameters together  (not recommended, but you
            can do it).  However, now a slant bar (/) may only be used
            as a  tag character  in a  /T parameter, or a delimiter or
            record terminator  character in  a /D  parameter if  it is
            preceded by  a back-slant  (\).   Otherwise, a  slant  bar
            marks the  beginning of  a new  parameter.  The caution on
            this subject  which appeared  in 3.20's notes has been re-
            moved, as it no longer applies.

          * This  started out  to be  maintenance release 3.14, but so
            many changes  were made, it certainly warrants a minor re-
            lease number.
          * Added  a subparameter (V) to the /S parameter.  /SV causes
            running status reports to be displayed on the console.

          * Corrected a minor bug in the statistics display.  When you
            sort a  file with  more than  32767 records, the number of
            records reported looked strange.
          * Revised  the method of displaying error messages, and made
            error message text more or less consistent.
          * Added  a whole  new section  to the  documentation dealing
            with error messages and their causes.
          * Revised  the method of parsing the command line.  Contrary
            to  the  documentation,  you  may  now  run  command  line
            switches together.   "/S/R/?/20:6/15:5"  will do precisely
            what you would expect.

          * This  release cleans  up the last (I hope) potential unde-
            tected I/O errors.

                             Notes on Version 3.12                             Notes on Version 3.12                             _____________________

          * A  bug (an  oversight, actually) has existed for some time
            which caused  QSORT to  fail to  recognize an "out of disk
            spate" condition  when writing temporary merge files.  The
            situation is corrected in this version.
          * The  QSTMP environment  variable was documented in version
            3.10,  but   through  another   oversighe,  not   actually
            implimented 'till  now.   The current  version will search
            for environment  variables QSTMP,  TMP and  TEMP  in  that
            order, looking for a place to put temporaries.

                             Notes on Version 3.11                             Notes on Version 3.11                             _____________________

          * Rewrote many internal functions in assembly language.

                             Notes on Version 3.10                             Notes on Version 3.10                             _____________________

          * Added support for delimited field records.  A side benefit
            of this feature is the ability to redefine the newline se-
            quence for this  and other types of ASCII files.
          * Improved output buffering.
          * Converted all documentation to Microsoft Word.

                             Notes on Version 3.00                             Notes on Version 3.00                             _____________________

          * Converted from Lattice C, version 3.1 to Microsoft C, ver-
            sion 4.0.   This  change alone  resulted in  about a  10 %
            improvement in performance.
          * Performed  major redesign  of QSORT's I/O, buffer handling
            and internal  data structures.  This change resulted in an
            additional 60 % performance improvement.  This improvement
            was measured by sorting the same 210K file:
               QSORT 2.1   1:48
               QSORT 3.00  0:42
          * Dropped support for QSORTL (large data model).

          * Removed  the necessity  for the  /M<len> parameter.  QSORT
            will now  sort files  with variable  length records of any
            size, provided  only that the two largest records will fit
            together in the sort buffer.  This imposes a record length
            constraint of  about 50K  for  the  sum  of  these  record
            lengths.
          * Added  the option  of specifying the output file as a com-
            mand line  argument.   The following  two commands are ex-
            actly equivalent:
               QSORT <INFILE >OUTFILE      and
               QSORT  INFILE  OUTFILE
          * Added support for the /? help parameter.
          * Added  the /S  parameter to  produce a "statistics" screen
            report at the end of a QSORT run.
          * Added  support for the QSTMP and TMP environment variables
            to specify a path for temporary merge files.
          * QSORT documentation was largely rewritten.

                              Notes on Version 2.1                              Notes on Version 2.1                              ____________________

          * Converted form Lattice C version 3.0 to version 3.1.
          * Added  /F<len>  parameter  and  support  for  fixed-length
            records.   Records may  contain binary data, but keys must
            be ASCII.
          * Added  several special-purpose  record  compare  routines.
            QSORT selects  the most  efficient one  for a  given sort,
            based upon the combination parameters on the command line.

          * Converted  from Lattice  C, version  2.14 to  version 3.0.
            This change achieved about 15 % performance improvement.
          * Began  distributing both  QSORT  and  QSORTL  (large  data
            model).   The latter shows performance gains on very large
            (> 750K) files.
          * Added  /T[<tag_char>] parameter and support for multi-line
            logical records.

          * Added "lexical" ordering of key fields.

                              Notes on Version 1.1                              Notes on Version 1.1                              ____________________

          * Added  /M<len>  parameter  to  permit  specifying  maximum
            record lengths in excess of the default 132 bytes.
          * Corrected  bug to permit <col> element of key field speci-
            fier to  be optional,  defaulting to column 1. Program now
            matches documentation.
