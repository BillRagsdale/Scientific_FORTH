\sepfootnotecontent{01_01}{This description refers to FORTH's compilation scheme. See, e.g. R.G. Loeliger, \textit{Threaded Interpretive Languages} (Byte Publications, Inc., Peterborough, NH, 1981). We shall have more to say about it in Chatper 2.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_02}{Although some interpreted FORTRANs such as WATFOR have been developed.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_03}{The original version of FORTRAN included naming conventions such that names beginning with letters I, J, K, L, M, and N are assumed to be integers, while those beginning with other letters are assumed to be single-precision floating point numbers. Subsequent versions have maintained this convention for backward compatibility.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_04}{The items between parentheses, (\dots), and following a backslash, "\textbackslash", are comments.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_05}{A \textbf{stack} is a data structure like a pile of cards, each containing a number. New numbers are added by placing them atop the pile, numbers are also deleted from the top. In essence, a stack is a "last-in, first-out" buffer.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_04}{Successive words in the input stream are separated from each other by blank spaces, ASCII 20hex, the standard FORTH delimiter.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_05}{We will explain about the stack in 2.3.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_06}{Since FORTH uses words, when we enter an input line we say the corresponding phrase.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_07}{This level could be either the outer interpreter or a word that invokes \bc{NEW-WORD}.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_01}{If a rectangle lies below the horizontal axis, its area is considered to be \textbf{negative}.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_02}{f'(x)is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point $x$. It is called the first derivative of $f(x)$.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_03}{This is not strictly correct: one could use a differential equation solver of the "predictor/corrector" variety, with variable step-size, to integrate Eq. 4. See, e.g., Press, et al., Numerical Recipes (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1986), pp. 102 ff.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_04}{That is, this statement defines $\bar{f}$.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_05}{The word % pushes what follows in the unput stream onto the 87stack, assuming it can be interpreted as a floating point number.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_09}{See, \eg Sedgewick, \textit{op. cit.}, p. 11.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_10}{Most FORTHs do not permit a word to call itself by name; the reason is that when the compiler tries to compile the self-reference, the deﬁnition has not yet been completed and so cannot be looked up in the dictionary. Instead, we use \textbf){RECURSE} to stand for the name of the self-calling word. See Note 14 below.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_11}{TRACE is specific to HS/FORTH, but most dialects will support a similar operation. \textbf{SSTRACE} is a modiﬁcation that sinde-steps through a program.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_12}{For examlpe, it is often claimed that removing recursion almost always produces a faster algorithm. See, \eg Sedgewick, \textit{op. cit.}, p. 12.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_13}{For generality we do not specify the integration rule for sub-intervals, but factor it into its own word. If we want to change the rule, we then need redeﬁne but one component (actually two, since the Richardson extrapolation --see Appendix 8.C-- needs to be changed also).}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_14}{We may deﬁne \bc{RECURSE} (in reverse order) as
\begin{lstlisting}
    : RECURSE ?COMP LAST-CFA , ;
    : ?COMP STATE @ 0= ABORT" Compile only!" ;
    : LAST-CFA LATEST PFA CFA ; IMMEDIATE
    \ These defintions are appropriate for HS/FORTH
\end{lstlisting}
Note that \bc{RECURSE} is called \bc{MYSELF} in some dialects.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_15}{We use the generalized arrays of Ch. 5 \S\ 3.4; A, B, and E are fp \#'s on the fstack, TYPE is the data-type of f(x) and INTEGRAL.}

\sepfootnotecontent{08_16}{The memory usage is shout the same: the recursive method pushes limits, \etc onto the fstack.}
