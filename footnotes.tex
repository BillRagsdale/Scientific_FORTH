\sepfootnotecontent{01_01}{This description refers to FORTH's compilation scheme. See, e.g. R.G. Loeliger, \textit{Threaded Interpretive Languages} (Byte Publications, Inc., Peterborough, NH, 1981). We shall have more to say about it in Chatper 2.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_02}{Although some interpreted FORTRANs such as WATFOR have been developed.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_03}{The original version of FORTRAN included naming conventions such that names beginning with letters I, J, K, L, M, and N are assumed to be integers, while those beginning with other letters are assumed to be single-precision floating point numbers. Subsequent versions have maintained this convention for backward compatibility.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_04}{The items between parentheses, (\dots), and following a backslash, "\textbackslash", are comments.}

\sepfootnotecontent{01_05}{A \textbf{stack} is a data structure like a pile of cards, each containing a number. New numbers are added by placing them atop the pile, numbers are also deleted from the top. In essence, a stack is a "last-in, first-out" buffer.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_05}{We will explain about the stack in \S2.3.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_06}{Since FORTH uses words, when we enter an input line we say the corresponding phrase.}

Another technique is to embed variables within a data structure so they cannot be referenccd inadvertently. Chapters 2\S8\S\S3-2, 3\S5\S\S2, 5\S1\S\S2 and 11\S2 offer examples.}

%\sepfootnotecontent{02_11}{\textbf{RDROP} is a handy way to exit from a word before reaching the final ";". See \TF.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_12}{The original FORTH-79 used +1 for "true", 0 for "false"; many newer system that mostly follow FORTH-79 use -1 for "true". HS/FORTH is one such. Both FORTH-83 and ANSII FORTH require -1 for "true", 0 for "false".}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_13}{This has led some FORTH gurus to prefer the synonymous word \bc{ENDIF} as clearer than \bc{THEN}.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_14}{Signed 16-bit integers run from -32768 to +32767, unsigned from 0 to 65535. See \FTR.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_16}{This usage is a non-standard construct of HS/FORTH.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_17}{Self-modifying machine code is considered a serious "no-no" by modern structured programming standards. Although it is sometimes valuable, few modern cpu's are capable of handling it safely. More often, because cpu's tend to use pipelining and parallelism to achieve speed, a piece of code might be modified in memory, but --having been pre-fetched before modification-- actually execute in unmodified form.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_18}{Of course \bc{CONSTANT} is usually a machine-code primitive, for speed.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_19}{An example (and its justification) of dimensioned data types in Ada is given by Do-While Jones, \textit{Dr. Dobb's Journal}, March 1987. The FORTH solution below is much simpler than the Ada version.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_20}{This example is based on 16-bit integer arithmetic. The word \regc{*/} means "multiply the third number on the stack by NOS, keeping 32 bits of precision, and divide by "TOS". That is, the stack comment for \regc{*/} is \regc{(a b c --a*b/c)}.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_21}{Headerless words are described in \FTR, p. 325ff. The word \textbf{BEHEAD'} is HS/FORTH's method for making a normal word into a headerless one. See Ch. 5\S1\S\S3 for further details.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_22}{Better methods will be described in Chapter 5.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_23}{The safety of an execution table can be increased by making the first (that is, the zero’th) action \textbf{WARNING}, and making the first step of \bc{BUTTON} a word \bc{CHECK-DATA} that maps any number not in the range 1-6 into 0. Then a wrong button number causes a \textbf{WARNING} to be issued and the system resets.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_24}{A single byte can represent positive numbers 0-255.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_25}{A system variable that returns the current starting address of the "scratchpad".}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_26}{\FTR, Ch. 3.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_27}{Ironially, most programmers refuse to get along without spaghetti code, so commercial Pascal's now include GOTO. Only FORTH among major languages completely eschews both line labels and GOTOs, making it the most structured language available.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_28}{The FORmula TRANsIator in Ch. 11\S4 uses this method to implement its recursive structure.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_29}{Rather like the "cell" system in revolutionary conspiracies, where members of a cell know only each other but not the members of other cells. Mechanisms for receiving and transmitting messages between cells are double-blind. Hence, if an individual is captured or is a spy, he can betray at most his own cell and the damage is limited.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_30}{The right parenthesis, ) , is not a word but a \textbf{delimiter}.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_31}{See, \textit{e.g.}, L. Brodie, \TF, Ch. 5, Appendix E.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_32}{For those familiar with assembly language, \textbackslash is exactly analogous to ; in assembler. But since ; is already used to close colon definitions in FORTH, the symbol \textbackslash has been used in its place.}

\sepfootnotecontent{02_33}{The matter of naming brings to mind Mark Twain's remark that the difference between the \textit{almost}-right word and the right one is the difference between the lightning-bug and the lightning.}

(WG) standard - see, e.g., Ray Duncan's and Martin Tracy's article in Dr.
Dobb's Journal, September 1984, p. 110. The new ANSII standard does not address

default.}
\sepfootnotecontent{03_02}{F@ and F! stand for a suite of words for fetching

\sepfootnotecontent{08_10}{Most FORTHs do not permit a word to call itself by name; the reason is that when the compiler tries to compile the self-reference, the deﬁnition has not yet been completed and so cannot be looked up in the dictionary.

\sepfootnotecontent{08_11}{TRACE is specific to HS/FORTH, but most dialects will support a similar operation. \textbf{SSTRACE} is a modiﬁcation that sinde-steps through a program.}

\sepfootnotecontent{09_08}{A Computer stores a number with finite precision --
say 6-7 decimal places with 32-bit floating-point numbers. This is enough for
many purposes, especially in science and engineering, where the data are rarely
measured to better than 1\% relative precision. Suppose, however, that two
numbers, about $10^{-2}$ in magnitude, are multiplied. Their product is of
order $10^{-4}$ and is known to six significant figures. Now add it to a third
number of order unity. The result will be that third number $\pm10^{-4}$.
Later, a fourth number -- also of order unity -- is subtracted from this sum. The
result will be a number of order $10^{-4}$, but now known only to two
significant figures. Matrix arithmetic is full of multiplications and
additions. The lesson is clear -- to minimize the (inevitable) loss of
precision associated with round-off, we must try to keep the magnitudes of
products and sums as dose as possible.}
\sepfootnotecontent{09_09}{The exception to this general rule, where more
complete optimization would pay, would be an application that requires solving
many sets of equations of relatively small order.}

Moore. FORTH's inventor, as offering 1-line definitions as the goal in FORTH
programming, sometimes this is just not possible.}
\sepfootnotecontent{09_13}{The \textbf{condition} of a system of linear
equations refers to how accurately they can be solved. Equations can be hard to
solve precisely if the inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ has some large elements. Thus,
the error vector for a calculated solution, $\delta=b-A \cdot X_{Calc}$ can be
small, but the difference between the exact solution and the calculated
solution can be large, since (see \S9\S3 below)
\begin{equation*}
	X_{Exact}-X_{Calc}=A^{-1}\cdot\delta\,.
\end{equation*}
A test for ill-condition is whether the determinant gets small compared with the precision of the
arithmetic. See, \textit{e.g.}, A. Ralston,\textit{A First Course in Numerical Analysis} (McGraw-Hill Book Co.,
New York, 1965).}
\sepfootnotecontent{09_14}{We employ the standard notation that a vector u is a

the corresponding position in a row-vector.}
