Dear Professor Montgomery,

  I hereby state that, as holder of the copyright for Julian Noble's book Scientific Forth,

  I have no objection to a digital version of this work being made publicly available on the internet.

  I would like to know a bit more about current interest in Julian's book as I understood that Forth is not widely used.

  Hope the above will serve as the statement you were requesting.

Best,

Harriet Noble
