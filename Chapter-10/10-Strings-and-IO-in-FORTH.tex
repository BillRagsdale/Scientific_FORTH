\chapter{Strings and I/O in FORTH}

\TallC{This} chapter describes some input and output (\textbf{I/O}) functions and string handling facilities needed for scientific computing. We will illustrate with words that capture screen output to a disk file, and with a word that translates a FORTRAN expression -- entered from keyboard or read in from a file -- to FORTH code.

\section{Standard I/O In FORTH}

One area where more conventional languages excel FORTH in convenience for the casual technical user/programmer is standardized I/O. FORTRAN offers all the needed functionality -- number formatting, strings, \textit{etc.} -- albeit in a somewhat rigid form.

BASIC, a more modern language, offers even more convenient built-in I/O facilities than FORTRAN.

I confess I personally do not find the practices of C or Pascal congenial, but most programmers seem able to live with them.

FORTH possesses no standardized I/O words except for writing to the screen and inputting from the keyboard. Thus there are no required words for redirecting output to printer, disk file or plotter.

FORTH lacks standard I/O functions for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Historically, FORTH incorporated its own (rather primitive) operating system (\textbf{OS}) on many machines. The aim was compactness rather than sophistication, so it eschewed built-in OS or BIOS ("\textbf{B}asic \textbf{I}nput/\textbf{O}utput \textbf{S}ystem) functions and/or device drivers.
    \item FORTH has been implemented on so many machines that hardware independence in I/O has seemed an unattainable goal.
\end{itemize}

FORTH developers have therefore deemed it better to let each programmer develop his own favorite techniques and specialized device drivers. The result is Bedlam.

\section{Standard I/O in Scientific FORTH}

\TallC{While} the freedom to custom tailor I/O is very nice when unusual problems crop up, no one likes having to roll his own subroutines to do routine tasks (95\% of all I/O is routine). A scientific FORTH dialect needs to standardize this routine 95\%. This book is intended for dialects like HS/FORTH that run under an operating system\sepfootnote{10_01} and are file oriented. Such dialects necessarily contain a reasonable spectrum of words for disk, screen and printer I/O, equivalent to those in HS/FORTH that I will employ in this chapter.

Some FORTHS are screen oriented. That is, they are designed to read and write blocks of 1024 bytes, displayed as 16 lines of 64 characters per line. This was a great idea for primitive machine like the Timex/Sinclair ZX81 or Jupiter Ace, but in my opinion is thoroughly inappropriate for modern work stations with sophisticated displays.

I strongly recommend users of screen oriented FORTHs to update to file oriented systems. Failing that, they should consult any of the numerous introductory books, or articles in journals such as \textit{Dr. Dobb's Journal}, for suggestions on using 1K blocks to store and input numbers and text.

\subsection{Disk file input}
We now tackle the problem of inputting data from disk files.
HS/FORTH provides the words \bc{OPEN-INPUT}, \bc{CLOSE-INPUT}, \bc{<FILE}, \bc{\$"}, \bc{G\#}, \bc{G\$}, \bc{NR}, and \bc{\$->F} that will suffice for our needs\sepfootnote{10_02}. Their effects are:

\begin{lstlisting}
    OPEN-INPUT   \ open a file for input, whose name is a
                 \ string whose address is on the stack.
    CLOSE-INPUT  \ close an open input file
    <FILE        \ get input from the open tile
    $"           \ put a string at PAD (terminate with ")
    G#           \ get a 16-bit number from open device
    G$           \ get a counted string from open device
                 \ (will not read past a CR-LF)
    NR           \ skip CR-LF to next record
    $->F         \ convert the string at PAD to a floating
                 \ point number on the 87stack.
\end{lstlisting}

\leftbar[1\linewidth]
\Note: Most operating systems handle sequential files by maintaining a pointer into the file.
After a datum is read, the pointer is advanced.
Suppose the file \textit{dat.fil} has 3 numbers in it: 17, 32 and -8.
Then the phrase
\endleftbar

\begin{lstlisting}
  $" dat.fil" <FILE G#
\end{lstlisting}

will place 17 on the stack. A repetition will place the number 32 on the stack, and a third repetition will place -8 on the stack.

We shall use the following data file convention for arrays:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first number is the type of the array.
    \item The second is the order N.
    \item the third is the number of entries -- N$^2$ for a matrix (2ARRAY), N for a vector (1ARRAY).
    \item One or more ASCII blanks (20h, 32d) separate the numbers in the file.
    \item The entries in a 2ARRAY are stored row-wise.
\end{itemize}

These conventions let one word serve for \bc{1ARRAY}s and \bc{2ARRAY}s.

Coding from the top down, we plan to enter the following phrases to load the file:

\begin{lstlisting}
    IN SUPERSEG 100 LONG REAL 1ARRAY A{
    A{ $" (*@\textit{data.fil}@*)" FILL<FILE
\end{lstlisting}

To minimize our labor let us plan to have the word \bc{FILL<FILE} close \textit{data.fil} after reading it in. For safety we also should check whether the type and order of the array we are filling, and that the array stored in the file are commensurate.

To check whether the file is too large or of the wrong type, we have\sepfootnote{10_03}

\begin{lstlisting}
    0 VAR FILE.TYPE
    0 VAR FILE.LEN
    : READ.FILE.STATS <FILE
        G# IS FILE.TYPE
        G# IS FILE.LEN ;

    : MAT>=FILE?                 ( a{ -- a{ )
       DUP D.TYPE   OVER D.LEN   ( -- a{ T L )
       FILE.LEN >                ( -- a{ T f1 )
       SWAP FILE.TYPE =          ( -- a{ f1 f2 )
       AND NOT
       ABORT" File bigger than array" ;
\end{lstlisting}

The rest of the definition will look something like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
    : COMPLEX? FILE.TYPE 10 > ;     \ is it complex?
    : EOR? <FILE G$ COUNT 0 = ;
    : F#.NR EOR?
       IF <FILE NR G$ DROP THEN     \ start new record
       PAD $->F DROP ;              \ convert to floating

    : FILL<FILE                     ( A{ $filespec -- )
        OPEN-INPUT                  \ open file for input
        MAT>=FILE?                  \ check type & length
        FILE.LEN 0
              DO DUP I 0}           ( -- A{ seg off type )
                  COMPLEX?
                  IF F#.NR THEN     \ enter 2 #'s
                        F#.NR GI    \ put away
              LOOP  DROP
        CLOSE-INPUT ;               \ clean up
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Disk file output}

\TallC{Suppose} one wants to write an array to a file.
We can use

\begin{lstlisting}
    A{{ $" data.fil" MAT>FILE
\end{lstlisting}
or
\begin{lstlisting}
    B{ $" data.fil" VEC>FILE
\end{lstlisting}

where we define\sepfootnote{10_04}

\begin{lstlisting}
    : MAT>FILE             ( a{{ $adr -- )
       MAKE-OUTPUT         \ $adr = file.spec
       >FILE DUP D.TYPE .
       DUP D.LEN DUP . **2 .
       .M CLOSE-OUTPUT ;

    : VEC>FILE             ( V{ $filespec -- )
       MAKE-OUTPUT
       >FILE D.TYPE .
       D.LEN DUP . .
       .V CLOSE-OUTPUT ;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Logging screen activity}
\TallC{Most} FORTHs handle output to a device by vectoring through a user variable called \bc{EMIT}. This allows relatively easy output redirection. Hence, for example, everything sent to the screen can be echoed to the printer (in an MS-DOS system operating on a PC-clone this is trivial: just press ctrl-PrtSc to toggle printer logging on or off).

The terminal sessions reproduced in preceding chapters were captured by logging development sessions to disk files. This is far safer than logging to a memory segment or ram-disk because it produces a record that remains even if oneâ€™s experiments crash the system. Logging to the printer is also permanent, but the results are not easily inserted into a book!

HS/FORTH permits (at least!) two simple methods for redirecting output, which we now describe.

\subsection{Redirection by re-vectoring}
\TallC{The} first word in this set of definitions creates the logging file.

\begin{lstlisting}
    : MAKE.LOG.FILE
       CR   ." Insert a formatted disk in drive A:"
       CR   ." Press any key to continue, Esc to abort..."
       KEY 27 = ABORT" ABORTED!"
       $" A:LOG.TXT"   MAKE-OUTPUT ;

    : REOPEN.LOG.FILE
       $" A:LOG.TXT" OPEN-OUTPUT ;

    : FWEMIT       \ a word to replace a standard EMIT
       DUP         \ duplicate a character
       FEMIT       \ emit to open file
       OUT 1-!     \ decrement the output count
       WEMIT ;     \ emit to the CRT (this increments OUT)

    : FCRT  CFA'  FWEMIT  IS EMIT ;  \ vector new routine

    : LOG-ON  FCRT \ all I/O to file \& CRT
       IO-STAY ;   \ normally FCRT would stop
                   \ after word executes.
                   \ IO-STAY leaves FCRT on.

    : LOG-OFF  CLOSE-OUTPUT  IO-RESET ;
                   \ IO-RESET restores I/O
                   \ to standard device
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Redirection using MS-DOS resources}

Assembly language programmers familiar with MS-DOS\sepfootnote{10_05} versions 2.x and higher will be aware that the operating system includes many useful functions. Those employed here are invoked by means of an ``interrupt'' (meaning the CPU halts what it was doing and performs the system function).

The interrupt code to invoke functions is 21h (hex).
The system functions are usually specified by placing the function number in register AH, and other needed information is placed in other registers. Then an INT 21 instruction is issued.

For example, to create a new file (or to overwrite an old one of the same name), a program operating under MS-DOS would include the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}
    MOV DX, FILESPEC  ; FILESPEC is address of
                      ; a string ending with ASCII 0
                      ; containing [d:][\path\]file.ext
    MOV AH, 3CH       ; the function number of "create"
    MOV CX, 0H        ; the file attribute
    INT 21H           ; now perform the interrupt
\end{lstlisting}

Consulting the MS-DOS Programmer's Reference\sepfootnote{10_06} reveals that Function 3Ch either leaves an error code in AX (if there was error -- depicted by having the carry flag bit CF = 1); or leaves the file handle number (if all went well -- depicted by CF = 0) in AX.

The HS/FORTH word \bc{MKFILE} expects the address of a counted string on the stack. This string contains the drive, path and filename of the new file. Then \bc{MKFILE} performs the interrupt (using code akin to that above) to invoke the function, issues an error message if something went wrong, and leaves the \textbf{file hand number} on the stack if all went well.

This \textbf{file handle number} is MS-DOS's way to refer to the new file internally. All subsequent references -- say to read or write -- are made to this number rather than to the FILESPEC (which would be much more tedious). The word \bc{MAKE-OUTPUT} used above contains \bc{MKFILE} as a component.

Now what does all this have to do with the price of bananas in the Maldive Islands? One of the features of MS-DOS is to treat \textit{everything} like a file, including the printer, CRT, serial ports, \textit{etc}. Thus output intended for the printer can be sent to a file by fooling DOS into thinking the file was the printer. This can be â€˜ done by placing the fileâ€™s file handle number where the printerâ€™s should be.

But MS-DOS actually has functions we can use to \textbf{splice} two file handle numbers so that they are subsequently treated as a single file. These are Function 45h (duplicate a file handle specified in BX: take an already open file and return a new handle that refers to the same file at the same position) and Function 46h (force a duplicate of a file handle specified in BX: take an already open file and force another handle in CX to refer to the same file at the same position; if the file handle specified in CX was open, close it).

Function 45h is used in the HS/FORTH word \bc{DUPH}, and 46h is used in \bc{SPLICEH}. We can combine them with the (already defined) printer-logging word \bc{PCRT}, as well as with \bc{IO-STAY} and \bc{CRT}, to let DOS perform the redirection of output:

\begin{lstlisting}
    0 VAR LOG-HANDLE
    0 VAR P-H#         \ VARs for storing handles
    : LOG-ON $" A:LOG.TXT" MKFILE
                       \ make file, leave handler#
       IS LOG-HANDLE   \ store file handle#
       4 DUPH IS P-H#  \ make new printer handle#
                       \ and store it
       LOG-HANDLE
       4 SPLICEH       \ splice the handle#'s
    PCRT IO-STAY ;     \ redirect output to
                       \ printer & CRT & leave on

    : LOG-OFF P-H# DUP
       4 SPLICEH      \ splice printer back to printer
       LOG-HANDLE CLOSEH
                      \ flush to log-file, close
       CLOSEH         \ close new printer handle
       CRT ;          \ go back to CRT only
    BEHEAD" LOG-HANDLE P-H#        \ make VARs local
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Redirection while DEBUGging}

\TallC{The} only problem with the logging functions defined above is that they depend on an idiosyncrasy of MS-DOS called the \textit{environment}. That is, when we execute a program from within another using the HS/FORTH word \bc{DOS"} we automatically create a new shell and run all DOS commands under a second copy of the command processor, COMMAND.COM\sepfootnote{10_07}. This means the environment variables -- specifically the handles of open files -- will not be valid. Hence the output sent to the screen by a program being run \textit{via} DOS" will not be echoed to the log file.

To capture screen output while DEBUGging, I resort to a utility published in PC Magazine called PRN2FILE\sepfootnote{10_08}. This utility replaces the DOS printer-interrupt routine (INT 17h) by a modification that sends the output to a file instead of the printer. The assembly language listing can be downloaded from PCMag.Net, and is included on the program disk as a convenience to the reader.

To use this utility from within HS/FORTH, first say DOS" < cr > to get into the DOS shell. A DOS prompt such as C> should appear.
Now give the DOS commands

\begin{lstlisting}
C> prn2file log.fil [/b8]
C> ctrl-PrtSc         ( toggle echoing to printer)
C> debug              ( get into DEBUG)
...... debugging session ......
-q                    ( quit DEBUG)
C> ctrl-PrtSc         ( stop echoing to printer)
C> prn2file           ( with no argument, closes log.fil)
                      ( and redirects back to printer)

C> type log.fil       ( check that it has worked)
C> exit               ( get back to HS/FORTH)
\end{lstlisting}

Although this is somewhat cumbersome, \textbf{it does what I need}, and I did not have to write my own.

With the illustration of how to use HS/FORTH's MS-DOS extensions to fill an array from a file, to send the contents of an array to a file of standard structure, and to capture programming sessions to a file, we have reached the end of the I/O trail.
