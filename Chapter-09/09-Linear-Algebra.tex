Two common problems in scientific programming are the
numerical solution of simultaneous linear algebraic equation
and computing the inverse of a given square matrix. This is sue".
an important subject As an exercise in FORTH program
development we shall now write programs to solve linear equations and invert matrices.

\section{Simultaneous linear equations}
\TallC{ We } begin with a dose of mathematics (linear algebra), and 
then develop programs. Several actual programming session
are reproduced \textit{in toto} --mistakes and all-- to give the flavor of
program development and debugging 1n FORTH.
\subsection{Theory oi linear algebraic equations}
\TallC{ We } begin by stating the problem. Given the equations
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}A_{mn}x_n=b_m \;.
\end{equation}
--more compactly written $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{x} = \vec{b}$-- with known coemcielt
matrix $A_{mn}$ and known inhomogeneous term $b_m$: under what
conditions can we find unique values of x... that simultaneoust
satisfy the N equations 1?

The theory of simultaneous linear equations tells us that if not all.
the bm' s are 0, the necessary and sufficient condition for so]-

vability is that the determinant of the matrix A. should not be 0.
Contrariwise, if det(' )= 0, a solution with x at 0 can be found
when 5= 0.

Many physical systems can be represented by systems of linear

equat'ons. Masses on springs, pendula, electrical circuits,
structures , and molecules are examples. Such systems often can
oscillate sinusoidally. If the amplitude of oscillation remains
bounded, such motions are called stable. Conversely, sometimes
the motions of physical systems are unbounded —the amplitude
of any small disturbance will increase exponentially with time. An
example is a pencil balanced on its point. Exponentially growing
motions are called -for obvious reasons - unstable.

Clearly it can be vital to know whether a system is stable or
unstable. If stable, we want to know its possible frequencies of
free oscillation; whereas for unstable systems we want to know
how rapidly disturbances increase in magnitude. Both these
problems can be expressed as the question: do linear equations
of the form

K-i'= Air-if (2)

have solutions? Here A is generally a complex number, mllcd the
eigenvalue (or characteristic value) of Eq. 2, and fi'is often called
the mass matrix. Frequently K is the unit matrix I,

1, m=n
I"'"-{0,m=tn, (3)

but in any case, I must be positive-definite (we define this
below). A non-trivial solution, x is 0, of the equation

K-ii'=o (4)

exists if and only if "I" = o . This fact is useful in solving eigen-
value problems such as Eq. 2 above.

The secular equation (or determinantal equation)

III—m=o (5)

is a polynomial of degree N inl, hence has N roots (either real ori
co.mplex) When p'= T, these roots are called the eigenvalues
(or' 'characteristic values") of the matrix K

Eigenvalue problems arising in physical contexts usually involve
a restricted class of matrices, called real-symmetric or Hermitiant

(after the French mathematician Hermite) matrices, for which.

A;,, =Am . (The superscript . denotes complex conjugation $-\_:$

see Ch. 7.) All the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are and:
numbers. How do we know? We simply consider Eq. 3 and its
complex conjugate:

 

2AM x,| = 112 pm xn ; (6a)

2 x:A:'m = 1' 2 x: pi. ; (6b)
Equation 6b can be rewritten (using the fact that K and flare.
Hermitian)

2 MIA"... = 1' 2 x; Pm (6b')
Multiply 6b' by xm and 63 by x; , sum both over at and subtract:
this gives

0= (if—i) 2 x;p.,,x,. (7)

However, as noted above, p is positive-definite, Le.

p(z): a0 + all + azzz +.. .+ anz" =0, of degree n (in a complex variable 2) has exactly a solutions ,

ln vibration problems, the eigenvalue A usually stands for the
square of the (angular) vibration frequency: )1 2 (oz. Thus, a posi-
tive eigenvalue). corresponds to a (double) real value, 1w, of the
angular frequenq. Real frequencies correspond to sinusoidal
vibration with time-dependence sin(alr) or cos(wi).

Conversely, a negative). corresponds to an imaginary frequency,
ti al and hence to a solution that grows exponentially in time, as

sin(l' (0!) = isinh(wr)

There are many techniques for finding eigenvalues of matrices.
If only the largest few are needed, the simplest method is itera-

tion: make an initial guess x (0) and let

Assuming the largest eigenvalue is unique,the sequence of vec-

tors xm , n = 1, 2,..., is guaranteed to converge to the vector
corresponding to that eigenvalue, usually after just a few itera-
lions.

Ifall the eigenvalues are wanted, then the only choice is to solve
the secular equation 5 for all N roots.

The test-and-development cycle in FORTH is short compared
with most languages. It is usually easy to create a working
program that subsequently can be tuned for speed, again much

more rapidly than with other languages. For me this is the chief 1
benefit of the language.

"I Cramer's rule

Cramer's rule is a constructive method for solving linear equa

tions by computing determinants. It is completely impractical
as a computer algorithm because it requires 0(N!) steps to solve
N linear equations, whereas pivotal elimination (that we look at
below) requires 0(N3) steps, a much smaller number. Neverthe—
less Cramer's rule is of theoretical interest because it is a closed—
form solution.

Consider a square NXN matrix A Pretend for the moment we'
know how to compute the determinant of an (N-1)x(N-1)'
matrix. The determinant of A is defined to be

N—l
det(A) = 2 A...,,a,,,,

n-O

where the amn's are called co-factors of the matrix elementsA...
and are in fact determinants of specially selected (N-1)x(N-1)
sub-matrices of A. '

The sub-matrices are chosen by striking out of A the n'th column
and m'th row (leaving an (N-1)X(N-1) matrix). To illustrate,
consider the 3 X3 matrix

1
A = a (11)
1

4M0
% (7)-#01

and produce the co-factor of A 12:

 

.21-(-1)2+'

We also attach the factor (-l)"'+" to the determinant of the
submatn'x when we compute a". .

K's-DO

A determinant changes sign when any two rows or any two

columns are interchanged. Thus, a determinant with two iden-
tical rows or columns is exactly zeros. What would happen to
Eq. 11 if instead of putting A," in the sum we put A" where
krtm? By inspection we realize that this is the same as evaluating
a determinant in which two rows are the same, hence we get zero.
Thus Eq. 11 can be rewritten more generally

This feature of determinants lets us solve the linear equation
A 'x = b by construction: try

1 N-l

xii = d—etm E: anmbm- (14)

We see from Eq. 13 that Eq. 14 solves the equation. Equation 14
also makes clear why the solution cannot be found if det(A) = 0.

A determinant also vanishes when a row is a linear combination
of any of the other rows. Suppose row 0 can be written

that is, the O'th equation can be derived from the other N-l
equations, hence it contains no new information. We do not really
have N equations for N unknowns, but at most N-1 equations. The
N unknowns therefore cannot be completely specified, and the
determinant tells us this by vanishing.

As an example, we now use Cramer's rule to evaluate the deter-
minant of Eq. 11. We will write

In other words, the time required to solve N linear equations by
Cramer's rule increases so rapidly with N as to render the method
thoroughly impractical.

The algorithm we shall use for solving linear equations is elimina-
tion, just as we were taught in high school algebra. However we
modify it to take into account the experience of 40 years's solving
linear equations on digital computers (not to mention a previous
20 years's worth on mechanical calculators!), to minimize the
buildup of round-off error and consequent loss of precision .

The necessary additional step involves pivoting —selecting the
largest element in a given column to normalize all the other

elements. This will be clearer with a concrete illustration rather
than further description: Consider the 3 X3 system of equations:

105 x0 0
324 1:1 =4 (15)
116 x2 2

We check that the determinant is \#0; in fact det(A) = 13. The first
step in solving these equations is to transpose rows in A and in b
to bring the largest element in the first column to the/loo position.

Natl-a;

e The x's are not relabeled by this transposition. ,

e We choose the row (n=1 ——second row) with the largest (in
absolute value) element Ano because we are eventually going
to divide by it, and want to minimize the accumulation of
roundoff error in the floating point arithmetic.

Transposition gives
3 2 4 xo 4
1 0 5 x1 = 0 (16)
1 1 6 x2 2

Now divide row 0 by the neono (in this case, 3) to get
1 2/3 4'3 x0 V3
1 0 5 x1 = 0 (17)
1 1 6 X2 2

Subtract row 0 times Ana from rows with n > 0
1 2/3 4': 10 V:
o —2/, 11/3 x, = -Va (13)
0 1'3 W: x, 26

 

Since |An| > |A21| we do not bother to switch rows 1 and 2, but
divide row 1 byAn =-2/3, getting

We now multiply row 1 by A" a 1/3 and subtract it from row 2,
and also divide through by A" to get

173 V3 10 V3
0 1 -u/2 x; 8 2 (20)
0 0 1 x; 0

 

The resulting transformed system of equations now has 0's to the
left and below the principal diagonal, and 1's along the diagonal.
Its solution is almost trivial, as can be seen by actually writing out
the equations:

1Xo+2/3X«| +V3X2=4/3 (21.0)
0x0 +1x1+(—11/2)X2 = 2 (21.1)
Oxo+0x1+1x2=0 (21.2)

That is, from Eq. 21.2, x; = 0. We can back-substitute this in 21.1,
then solve for x, to get

x, = 2 — (—11/2)-(0) = 2

and similarly, from 21.0 we find
xo=V3—2/3(2)+V3(0)=O.
We test to, see whether this is the correct solution by direct trial:
1-O+0-2+5-O=0
3-0+2-2 +4-0=4
1-O+2-2+6-O=2

Chapter 9 - Unear Algebra Scientific FORTH

How much time is needed to perform pivotal elimination? We
concentrate on the terms that dominate as N - on.

The pivot has to be found once for each row; this takes N-k
comparisons for the k'th row. Thus we make ~N l2 comparisons
of 2 real numbers. (For complex matrices we compare the
squared moduli of 2 complex numbers, requiring two multiplica-
tions and an addition for each modulus.)

We have to divide the k'th (pivot) row by the pivot, at a point in I
the calculation when the row contains N-k elements that have not \_
been reduced to 0. We have to do this for k = 0, 1, ..., N-l, '

requiring =N /2 divisions.

The back-substitution requires 0 steps for rm, 1 multiplication
and 1 addition for x", 2 each for it)", etc. That is, it requires

k=0
2 (N—l—k) =N2/2
k=N-1

multiplications and additions.

The really time-consuming step is multiplying the k'th row by
A", , j > k, and subtracting it from row j. Each such step requires
N-k multiplications and subtractions, for j=k+1 to N-l, or
(N -k) - (N —k— 1) multiplications and subtractions. This has to be
repeated for k= 0 to N-2, giving approximately N3/3 multiplica-

tions and subtracti30ns. In other words, the leading contribution l

to the time is rN 3/3, which is a lot better than reN! as with
Cramer' 5 rule.

Whenweog timize for speed, only the innermost loop —re uir-

mg O (N13 /3) operations needs careful tuning; the O (N [2) 3

operations — comparing floating point numbers, dividing by the .i

pivot, and back-substituting — need not be optimized bgecause for
large N they are overshadowed by the innermost loop .

The exception to this general rule, where more complete optimization would pay, would be an
application that requires solving many sets of equations of relatively small order.

"5 The program

Whenever we write a complex program we are faced with the
problem "Where do we begin?" FORTH emphasizes the con-

struction of components. and generally cares little which component
we define first.

For example. we must swap two rows of a matrix. The most
obvious way moves data:

row1 - > temp
row2 - > row1

temp -> row2

Although data moves are relatively fast, up to N2/2 swaps may be
needed, each row containing N data; row-swapping is an O (N 3)
operation which must be avoided. lndirectio setting up a list of
row pointers and exchanging those. uses 0 (N ) time.

From our pseudocode expression (see Fig. 9-1, p. 227) of the
pivotal elimination algorithm we see that the next operation is to
multiply a row by a constant. To do this we define

0 While DO(ROW'X)LO0P and ??ROW'X clear the param-
eter stack in approved FORTH fashion, they leave the constant
multiplier x on the fstack. That is, we antimpate next multipl -
ing the corresponding row of the inhomogeneous term b (in
the matrix equation A-x = b) by the same constant x.

e We assume INITIALIZE (includin INITJSTEP) has been
invoked before "PIVOT or "110 'X.

o Anticipating the (possible) need to optimize, we factor the loop
right out of the word. We also com me the addresses fast by
putting base addresses on the stac and then incrementing
them by the cell-size, in bytes.

Subtracting row 1 (times a constant) from row I is quite similar to
multiplying a row by a constant. The process can be broken down
into the pseudocoded actions in Fig, 9-3 below.

However, we are doing a lot of unnecessary work inside the loop
by making 5 choices based on datatype. There are also a lot ,
unnecessary moves to/from the ifstack. This is an example where
speed has been sacrificed to compactness of code: one program
solves equations of any ("scientific") data format — REAL'4,
REAL-8, COMPLEX'8 and COMPIJEX' 16. i

Conversely, we can both eliminate the extra work and accelerate?
execution simply by defining a separate inner loop for each data;
type, letting the choice take place once, outside the inner loopX
This multiplies the needed code fourfold (or more-fold, if we?
optimize).

% Chapter 9 — Linear Algebra Scientific FORTH

Since the Gaussian elimination method makes it very easy to
compute the determinant of the matrix as we go, we might as well
do so, especially as it is only an 0(N) process. By evaluating the
detemiinants of simple cases, we realize the determinant is simp-
ly the product of all the pivot elements, multiplied by

(\_1) swaps. Hence we need to keep track of swaps, as well as to
multiply the determinant (at a given stage) by the next pivot
element. The need to do these things has been anticipated in
defining \}SWAP above.

Computing the determinant also lets us test as we go, that the
equations can be solved: if at any stage the determinant is zero,
(at least) two of the equations must have been equivalent. Should
it be necessary to test the condition of the equations, this too
can be found as we proceed, by computing the determinant.

Here is a simple recipe for computing the determinant, with
checking to be sure it does not vanish identically. We use the
intelligent fstack (ifstack) defined in Ch. 7.

\begin{verbatim}
DCOMPLEX SCALAR DET \ room for any type

\end{verbatim} 

The condition of a system of linear equations refers to how accurately they can be solved. Equa-
tions can be hard to solve precisely if the inverse matrix A" has some large elements. Thus, the
error vector for a calculated solution, d= —-b-A szlc can be small, but the difference between the
exact solution and the calculated solution can be large, since (see \S9\S3 below)

xBar-ct 'cnc =A W6
A test for ill-condition is whether the determinant gets small compared with the precision of the
arithmetic. See, 43.3., A. Ralston,A First Course in Numerical Analysis (McGraw-Hill Book Co.,
New York, 1965).

Now at last we can back-solve the triangularized equations to find

the unknown x 's. The word for this is }BACK-SOLVE, defined
as follows:

\end{verbatim} 

Putting the entire program together we have the linear equation
solver given in the file SOLVEl. Examples of solving dense 3x3
and 4 X4 systems are included for testing purposes.

\S\S6 Timing

e should like to know how much time it will take to solve a

given system. (Of course it is also useful to know whether the
solution is correct!) We time the solution of 4' sets of N equations,
with 4 different values of N. The running time can be expressed
as a cubic polynomial in N with undetermined coefficients:

TN=ao+a1N1+azN2+agN3 (19)

Evaluating 19 for 4 different values of N, and measuring the 4
times TNi , we produce 4 inhomogeneous linear equations in 4

unknowns: a, , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 . As luck would have it, we just hap-

pen to have on hand a linear equation solver, and are thus in a
position to determine these coefficients numerically.

For this timing and testing chore we need an exactly soluble dense
system of linear equations, of arbitrary order. The simplest siqch
system involves a rank-1 matrix, that is, a matrix of the form :

 

14.

We employ the standard notation that a vector u is a column and an adjoint vector VIf '3 a row.
Their outer product, uvi, is a matrix. Given a column v, we construct its adjoint (row) VIt by
taking the complex conjugate of each element and placing it in the corresponding position in a

row-vector.

The solution of the system A 1 I: b is simple: using the standard
notation

vi-x a (v, x) = 2 v. 'x. (21)
we have
X. = D: 'i' (V, X) U. (22)

The coefficient (v, x) is just a (generally complex) number; we
compute it from 22 via

(V. X) — 1 \_ (v. u) . (24)

closed form.

We give the times only for the case of a highly optimized inner

The coefficients of the cubic polynomial extracted from the above
are (in seconds, 9.54 MHz 8086 machine, machine-coded inner

loop)

a0 = 032727304
a. = -0.01084850
32 = 000241636
33 = 000001539

from them we can extrapolate the time to solve a 350x350 real
system to be about 16 minutes. On a 25 MHz 80386/8038'7 ma-
chine with 32-bit addrgsing implemented, the time should
decrease five- to tenfold .

It is interesting to explore a bit further the extracted value of a3,

which is 3-
fined above as Re.LP and hand-coded in assembler for ultimate
speed). Converting to clock cycles on an IBM-PC compatible
(running at 9.54 MHz) we have an average of 440 clock cycles per
traversal (of this loop). Recall the operations that are needed: a
32-bit memory fetch, a floating-point multiply, another 32-bit
memory fetch, a floating-point subtraction, and a 32-bit store.
The initial fetch-and-multiply can be be compressed into a single
co-processor operation, as can the fetch-and-subtract. The times
in cycles for these basic operations are

ChapterO-LlnaarAlgebra SciandflcFOfl

We see from Table 9-2 above that the time computed from t
cpu and coprocessor specifications (422 clocks) is close to
measured time (440 clocks). The slight difference doub
comes both from measurement error and from the fact th
timing of CISC chips is not an exact art (for example, there a
periodic interruptions for dynamic memory refreshment and f
the system clock).

Finally, we confirm that little is to be gained by optimizing out
loops. Suppose, «5.3., we could halve a; by clever programmin
then we should cut the N =350 time from 16 to 13 minutes,
the time for N = 1000 by some 20 minutes in 5 hours, or 6%.

We introduce this subject with a brief discourse on liners
algebra of square matrices.

Suppose A is a square (NXN) matrix and x is an N-dimensiomi
vector (a column, or NXI matrix). We can think of the symbolic
operation

y= A -x (26)

 

as a linear transformation of the column x to a new column y. In
terms of matrix elements and components,

N—l
Ym= E Amnxn (27)

n-o

The transformation is linear because if x is the sum of 2 columns
(added component by component)

it = x") + is), (23) \_

l

we can calculate A 1 either by first adding the two vectors ant:
then transforming, written

A-x-A-(am+am) (29)

or we could transform first and then add the transformed vectors.
The identity of the results is called the distribatlvs law

A-x-A-(xm+a(2)) "amuse (30)
of linear transformations.

"2 Matrix m
Now, suppose we had several square matrices, A, B, 0,... We
could imagine performing successive linear transformations on a

vectorxvia
y= A -x (31a)
2= e -y (31b)
w = C -1 (31c)

These can conveniently be written

w=c-[B-(A-x) . (32)

 

The concept of successive transformations leads to the idea of
multiplying two matrices to obtain a third:

D=B-A E=C-D (33)
In terms of matrix elements we have, for example
N-I
Diir ' 1% all All- (34)

The important point is that the (matrix) multiplications may be
performed in any order, so long as the left-to-right ordering of
the factors is maintained:

Ci'iaptoro-LInaarAigabra Salem

   
  
  
  
  

c- (a -A) -=- (c .n) -A (35)

Equation 35 is known as the associative law of matrix multipli
tion. Finally, we note that —as hinted above— the left-to-ri
order of factors in matrix multiplication is significant. That is, i
general,

A-B¢B-A (36) 1

We say that, unlike with ordinary or even complex arithme '
matrix multiplication —even of s uare matrices— does not i
general obey the commutative law .

\S\S3 Matrix Inversion
With this introduction, what does it mean to invert a matrix? First
of all, the concept can apply only to a square matrix. Given an
NXN matrix A, we seek another N XN matrix A with theproper-
ty that

 

A"-AaA-A"=I (37)

where I is the unit matrix defined in the beginning of this chapte r
(Eq. 4 — 1's on the main diagonal, 0's everywhere else). We have:
implied in Eq. 37 that a matrix that is an inverse with respect to
left-multiplication is also an inverse with respect to right-multi-
plication. Put another way, we imply that

(r' )" a A (38)

The condition that - given A— we can construct A'1 is the same.|
as the condition that we should be able to solve the linear equa-(
tion

A-I-b;

t namely, det(A) u 0.

5'4 W invert matrices, W
We have developed a linear equation solver program already
—why should we be interested in a matrix inversion program?

Here is why: The time needed to solve a single system (that is,
with a given inhomogeneous term) of linear equations is condi-
tioned by the number of floating-point multiplications required:

about 143/111): number needed to invert the matrix is about N3,
roughly 3X as many, meaning roughly 3x as long to invert as to
solve, if the matrix is large. Clearly there is no advantage to
inverting unless we want to solve a number of equations with the
same coefficient matrix but with different inhomogeneous terms.
In this case, we can write

x=A'Lb a"

and just recalculate for each h. Clearly this breaks even — relative
to solving 3 sets of equations — for 3 different b's and is superior
to re-solving for more than 3 Us

Let us now calculate the inverse of our 3x3 matrix from before.

It is easy to see that Eq. 40 is like 3 linear equations, the unkn
being each column of the matrix C. The brute-force method I
calculate A is then to work on the right-hand-side all at once
we triangularize, and back-solve. It is easy to see that

To construct the inverse we replace the right-hand side with thq

elimination) of 0(N3). However, the brute-force method is un-
satisfactory for another reason: it takes twice the storage of more
sophisticated algorithms. Modern matrix packages therefore "8:"

Since we must sum n from 0 to N-l, we find N(N—1)/2 =4 Nz/Z
multiplications and additions to solve all of 46. Similarly, solving

dominant time in solving must be the time to decompose accord-
